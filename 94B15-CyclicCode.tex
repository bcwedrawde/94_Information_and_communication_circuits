\begin{document}
Let $C$ be a linear code over a finite field $A$ of block length $n$. $C$ is called a \emph{cyclic code}, if for every codeword $c=(c_1,\ldots,c_n)$ from $C$, the word $(c_n,c_1,\ldots,c_{n-1})\in A^n$ obtained by a \PMlinkescapetext{cyclic} right shift of \PMlinkescapetext{components} is also a codeword from $C$.

Sometimes, $C$ is called \emph{the} $c$-cyclic code, if $C$ is the smallest cyclic code containing $c$, or, in other words, $C$ is the linear code generated by $c$ and all codewords obtained by \PMlinkescapetext{cyclic} shifts of its \PMlinkescapetext{components}.

For example, if $A=\mathbb{F}_2$ and $n=3$, the codewords contained in the $(1,1,0)$-cyclic code are precisely
$$(0,0,0), (1,1,0), (0,1,1)\text{ and }(1,0,1).$$

Trivial examples of cyclic codes are $A^n$ itself and the code containing only the zero codeword.
