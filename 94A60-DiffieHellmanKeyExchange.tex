The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a cryptographic protocol for symmetric key exchange.  There are various implementations of this protocol.  The following interchange between Alice and Bob demonstrates the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
\begin{itemize}
\item 1)  Alice and Bob publicly agree on an elliptic curve $E$ over a large finite field $F$ and a point $P$ on that curve.
\item 2)  Alice and Bob each privately choose large random integers, denoted $a$ and $b$.
\item 3)  Using elliptic curve point-addition, Alice computes $aP$ on $E$ and sends it to Bob.  Bob computes $bP$ on $E$ and sends it to Alice.
\item 4)  Both Alice and Bob can now compute the point $abP$, Alice by multipliying the received value of $bP$ by her secret number $a$, and Bob vice-versa.
\item 5)  Alice and Bob agree that the $x$ coordinate of this point will be their shared secret value.
\end{itemize}

An evil interloper Eve observing the communications will be able to intercept only the objects $E$, $P$, $aP$, and $bP$.  She can succeed in determining the final secret value by gaining knowledge of either of the values $a$ or $b$.  Thus, the security of the exchange depends on the hardness of that problem, known as the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem.  For large $a$ and $b$, it is a computationally ``difficult'' problem.

As a side note, some care has to be taken to choose an appropriate curve $E$.  Singular curves and ones with ``bad" numbers of points on it (over the given field) have simplified solutions to the discrete log problem.
