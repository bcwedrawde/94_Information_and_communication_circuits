A binary code is called \emph{even} if the Hamming weight of all its
codewords is even. Furthermore, a binary code is called
\emph{doubly-even} if the Hamming weight of all its codewords is
divisible by $4$. An even code which is not doubly-even is said to be
\emph{strictly even}.

Examples of doubly-even codes are the extended binary Hamming code of
block length $8$ and the extended binary Golay code of block length
$24$. These two codes are, in addition, self-dual.
